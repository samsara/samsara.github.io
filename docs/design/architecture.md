## The idea behind

The basic idea behind the project is to have an analytics capable system
which has got everything included out of the box.

For those who like to measure things and want to understand better how
their user base interacts with their products, we prepared a system which
out of the box will give you:

  - a fast, scalable solution to ingest user/machine generated events
  - a real-time processing pipeline with a collection of common processing tools
  - an interactive frontend user interface to explore your data-set in real time.

Contrarily to most analytics systems, Samsara doesn't aggregate data
during the ingestion phase.  We leave the aggregation part at query
time which gives you more flexibility on choosing which events need to
be aggregated and how.

## Samsara's components

Samsara is composed of 4 major parts: _the ingestion APIs, the
real-time processing pipeline, the live index and query APIs, and the
frontend data exploration tool_.

There are several other components which are used for internal house keeping.

![Overall Architecture](/docs/images/architecture.png)

At the top of the stack we find the `Ingestion APIs`.  This tier is an
elastically scalable layer of RESTful web services.  They respond to
the client SDKs and accept the payload which is composed by one or
more events. These events are validated and then sent to a high
throughput queueing system such as
[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/).

Kafka stores the data locally for a certain amount of time, then using
eviction policies the data is removed. This interesting property allows
the consumer to rewind the topic back in time up to the maximum amount
of storage defined in the policy.

For additional durability all the data stored into Kafka is constantly
pulled and stored into a deep storage such as HDFS, AWS S3 or Azure
Blobs.

Every event sent to Kafka is then processed by Samsara's CORE.  Here
events are filtered, enriched and correlated to produce a much richer
stream of data.  Samsara uses a key-value store, typically an
**in-memory** k/v-store, which is backed by a Kafka stream for
durability, but you can optionally spill out to a external database
such [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).
Samsara CORE uses this in-memory kv-store for transient
processing data.  The output of Samsara is then sent into another
Kafka topic ready to be indexed.

[Qanal](https://github.com/samsara/samsara/tree/master/qanal), our
parallel indexer, takes the enriched streams of events and stores them
into [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/).

Once available in the index, the data is immediately queryable by the
frontend [Kibana](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/) which
allows to slice-and-dice the data as you need, it computes aggregations
and creates powerful real-time dashboards.

## Cloud independent vs Cloud Native

Each part of the system can be scaled independently focusing the power
in the areas which require it most. The system is build on top of
container technology such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and it
can run into Clouds such as AWS and Azure, as well as in premises or
your own data-center.

When running in a cloud you are able to choose between a fully cloud
independent solution which will leverage only the Virtual machine
system of the cloud or you can swap one or more component to use cloud
native offering.

The following table shows which native components can be used in a
cloud solution:


| Component    | Amazon Web Services | Azure Cloud        |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Kafka        | Amazon Kinesis      | EventsHub          |
| Cassandra    | Amazon DynamoDB     | Azure Table        |
| Deep storage | Amazon S3           | Azure Blob Storage |



When running in the cloud this is always better to use the load balancers
offered, unless you expect your traffic to have long flat lines
followed by huge spikes.  In that case it is better to run your own
load balancers and we recommend [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/).
