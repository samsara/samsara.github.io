## <a name="simple"/> Simple.

> _"The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity." (Tony Hoare)_

When I designed this system I had very hard timeline constraints. In
six weeks we went from a POC in my laptop to a scalable,
fault-tolerant production environment with just two people doing
everything: design, development, testing, operations, monitoring and
production support. With such timeline, I had to keep things
very very simple.

The decision was to only use systems which were easy to setup, easy to
understand, easy to debug, easy to maintain and which didn't require a
lot of time and effort in low-level fine tuning.

The choice of the language was easy, most of the tooling picked was on
the JVM, and [Clojure](http://clojure.org) is a very good choice when
the system is primarily data oriented. Its properties of immutable,
functional, LISP dialect made it an excellent choice for this project.
Most of all, the ability to do
[REPL Driven Development](http://blog.jayfields.com/2014/01/repl-driven-development.html)
allowed us to cut the development time enormously maintaining fairly
good quality.

Another important aspect was to be able to debug the system easily.
Again the REPL came useful a few times providing the possibility to
connect to a running system and inspect its state. Additionally, the
ability to easily inspect the data at every stage was a paramount
capability. Rushing the implementation so quickly would cause
possible defects which could be anywhere in the system, so designing
for _human-fault tolerance_ was another property we tried to
bake in the original design. Storing the raw data in verbatim
in deep storage, ability to safely re-process the data, possibility
to tear down one part of the system without losing events have
been factored in the design from the beginning.

The real-time processing part was the big question. Loads of
frameworks were available at the time. Things like:
[Storm](http://storm.apache.org/),
[Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/streaming/),
[Samza](http://samza.apache.org/), [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/)
were widely used, [Onyx](http://www.onyxplatform.org/) was a new
player in this field.  Yet, some had complicated processing semantics
to learn, required complicated clusters setup, spend time on tuning
topologies and some of them were mandating specific application
packaging requirements.

We decided to start simple. **The fundamental idea was to encapsulate
the stream processing into a (Clojure) function which was taking in
input a stream and producing a new (richer) stream as output.**

With such approach we could have picked any of the more established
stream processing systems later on and use it as scalable execution
environment as the semantic of stream processing were encapsulated
in our core; but to begin with we wrote our own Kafka consumers.

This choice became fundamentally important later on as it forged the
basis for deciding how to scale the system, providing strong guarantees
(ordering) for event processing and high data locality.

## <a name="realtime"/> Real-time.

Users of Samsara want to be able to see changes in metrics as they
happen.  Providing speed at scale was an important goal. _Samsara
provides "Real Time" Analytics_, but how much "real time" is depends
on various factors.

Samsara is not aiming to provide milliseconds or microseconds
latency. It is more what normally is called _near real-time_ and it
ranges from **sub-seconds to a few seconds** of end-to-end latency.
The good thing is that the latency is *tuneable*.

What does it mean to have _tuneable latency_?

In such systems you can typically trade _latency_ for _throughput_.
Which means that if you accept to have slightly longer latencies, you
can gain in system throughput. This is simply achieved by packing more
events in batches.  However if you need shorter latencies you can
configure Samsara to sacrifice some of the throughput.

In most of real life projects the throughput is not a variable that you
can control, you have a number of users which will send a number of events
and the system has to cope with it. So if we _lock_ the throughput dimension,
there is another dimension which can be influenced, and it is the amount
of hardware necessary to deliver a given throughput/latency value.

Ultimately in a cloud environment the amount of hardware used reflects
the infrastructure cost, in such environment you trade latency for
service cost.


![Tuneable latency](/docs/images/design-principles/tuneable-latency.gif)<br/>
_**[~] You can trade latency for throughput or less hardware..**_

## <a name="aggregation"/> Aggregation "on ingestion" vs "on query".

The design of analytics system broadly divides in two large
categories: _the ones who aggregate data during the ingestion_ and
_the ones who aggregate data at query time_. Both approaches have
advantages and drawbacks. We will try to see how these systems do work
and what are the key differences to better understand why a
particular solution was picked in Samsara.

### <a name="agg_ingestion"/> Aggregation on ingestion.

The following image depicts what commonly happens in systems which perform
aggregation on ingestion.

![Aggregation on ingestion](/docs/images/design-principles/agg-on-ingestion.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Upon ingestion of e new event, counters are updated in memory.**_

On the left side we have the _time_ flowing from top to bottom with a
number of different events sent to the system. The strategy here is to
split the _time continuum_ in discrete buckets. The size of the
buckets depends on your system requirements. These buckets are often
called _windows_ as well.

Let's assume we want to know the average number of events over the
last 3 seconds.

For this we need to create windows of _1 second_ each in our ingestion
layer.  Every bucket has a timestamp associated so that when we
receive a event we can look at the event's timestamp and increment the
counter for corresponding bucket.

As the time flows, we will receive a number of events and increment
the buckets. Buckets typically are stored in memory for performances
reasons.  After a certain period of time we will have to flush these
in-memory buckets back to a storage layer to ensure durability and
free up some memory for new buckets.

With this pretty simple approach there is already a number of
difficult challenges to address. For instance how often will we flush
the buckets to the durable storage? If we do it too often we will
overwhelm the storage with loads of very little operations.  On the
other side, if we decide to keep in memory for too long we incur the
risk for running out of memory or losing a number of events due to a
process crash.

Additionally, how do we manage events which arrive late? If they
arrive while we still have the corresponding bucket in memory, we can
simply increment the corresponding counter. However, if we have
already flushed the bucket to the durable storage and we have freed up
the memory we will be left with no corresponding bucket in memory.

There are several strategies to deal with late arrivals and there are
several papers which explain benefits of the different strategies.
Whatever decision we take these are hard problems to solve in a reliable
and efficient manner.

Once data is flushed to the permanent storage is becomes ready to be queried.
Some systems allow to query also the in-memory buckets at the ingestion
layer to shorten the latencies.
The query engine will have to select a number of buckets based on
the query parameters and sum all counters. At this point it is ready
to return the result back to the user.

If you think that this was complicated just to get the average number
of events, just sit tight, there is more to come.

Now when I've got the overall number of events, as a user, I realize
that I need to understand how this value breaks down in relation to
the type (shape) of events I've received.

To do so, one bucket per second is not enough. _We need a bucket
per second per type of event_. With such buckets structure
I can now compute not only the total number of events per second,
but also the number of _stars_ per seconds, for example.

There is more. What if, what I really wanted was the number of _red
stars_ per second. Well, we have to start from scratch again, this
information is not available in the current information model because
we took the raw events, we aggregated them and discarded the original
events in favour an aggregated view only.

In order to compute the number of _red stars_ per second we need to go
back to our information model and duplicate all buckets for every type
of colour we handle.

#### Number of buckets explosion.

The image below shows the difference between the three queries on the
same events and the buckets required to compute them.

![Num Buckets explosion](/docs/images/design-principles/agg-explosion.gif)<br/>
_**[~] The number of buckets explodes for every new dimension to explore**_

You can easily see how, even in this very simple example, the number
of buckets and the complexity start to explode exponentially for
every dimension that we need to track.

For example just for this simple example, if we want to be able to run
query across this data and retain 1 year worth of data we will need to
create a bucket for every second in a year (31M circa), however
querying across several weeks or months can become prohibitive due to
the large number of small buckets to lookup. A common strategy is to
roll small buckets up into larger one creating aggregated buckets at
for minutes, hours, days and so on. By doing so, if I'm requesting the
number of events across the last 3 days I can just aggregate last 3
daily buckets, or mix daily buckets with hours, minutes and seconds to
get finer granularity. So if I need to query across last 3 months I
have a significant smaller number of buckets to look up.

However this has a cost. In this picture there is the breakdown of
how many buckets will be required to be able to flexibly and efficiently
query the above simple example across 1 year.

![Num Buckets](/docs/images/design-principles/num-buckets.gif)<br/>
_**[~] The number of buckets required even for simple cases is huge**_

As you can see we need to keep track of *32 million* buckets just for
1 year worth of data, and this _just for the time buckets_, now we
have to multiply this figure for every dimension in your dataset and
every cardinality in each and every dimension.  For this basic example
which only contains 2 dimensions: the event type (4 categories) and the
colour (2 categories) we will require **over 256 million** buckets,
and above all __we still haven't stored the event itself__.

Luckily there is another way.


### <a name="agg_query"/> Aggregation on query.

If we consider the same situation with a typical aggregation on query
architecture we see a different story.

Again on the left side we have time flowing from top to bottom, and a
number of events reaching the system. This time we consider the _time
continuum_ as fluid as the reality, no need to create discrete
buckets.  As we receive an event, in ingestion we can process it
straightaway.  While in the previous scenario we had to be mindful of
the number of dimensions, here we are encouraged to enrich each event
with many more dimensions and attributes and make it easier to query.

Each event is processed by a custom pipeline in which enrichment,
correlation and occasionally filtering, take place. At the end of the
processing pipeline we have a richer event with more dimensions
possibly denormalised as we might have used some internal dataset to
join to this stream. The output goes into the storage and indexing
system where the organisation is radially different.

![Aggregation on query](/docs/images/design-principles/agg-on-query.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Upon ingestion of e new event, we enrich the event and store into information retrieval inverted index.**_

First major difference is that the indexing system stores the event
itself.  Then it analyses all its dimensions and creates a bucket for
each property.  In this bucket it adds a pointer back to the original
event.

As the picture shows the bucket for the color "red" is pointing to all
red events in our stream, and as more red events arrive they are added to
this bucket. Same thing happens for the "yellow" events and for the
different shapes. Virtually, also the time can be considered in a
similar way, although the time is most system is considered a
"special" dimension and it is used for physical partitioning.
But for the purpose of this description we can consider pretty much
in the same way.

These newly created buckets are just
[sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)) and every set
just contains the ids of the events which have that property.  Now if
we are looking for all events in a specific timeframe, all we need to
do is to take all these sets (buckets) with a timestamp within the
range and perform a
[set union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Unions).

Now if we want to know all "red" events for the same timeframe, we
do a union of the sets within the time range and an
[intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Intersections)
of the resulting set with the "reds" set.  There are plenty of
optimisations to this high level view but the idea stays the same.
This type of index structure is called
[Inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index).

Because the aggregation happens at query time, the handling of events
which arrives late is no different than the normal events.  They get
processed in the same way, enriched and stored like any other event.
As they are added to the corresponding set for each dimension they are
directly available for query and accounted in the correct aggregations.

### <a name="agg_best"/> Which approach is best?

Both approaches have advantages and drawbacks. Which one you should
choose really depends on the use you are going to make of the data.

The aggregation on ingestion offers good performances even for very
large datasets as you don't store the raw data-points but only
aggregated values. However a problematic point is that you have to
know all the queries you will run ahead of time. So if you have a
_small fix number of queries_ which you have to serve continuously
then that's a optimal approach.

In the projects I've been working on, I was looking for a system which
would be flexible and support interactive and fast data exploration.
In other words you couldn't predict ahead of time all or most of the
queries which would be performed over the data. In such cases
aggregation on ingestion is the wrong approach. The combinatorial
explosion of dimensions and values would make the ingestion too slow
and complicated. To perform arbitrary queries on any of the available
dimensions you need to store the original value and prepare your
storage for such case.

If query flexibility is what you are looking for, like the ability to
slice and dice your dataset using any of the available dimensions then
the aggregation on query is the only solution.

Nowadays, most of the real-world systems have a mixed approach,
but the difference is still evident when looking on how the storage
layer is organized.

## <a name="overview"/> Samsara's design overview.

In Samsara we focus on agility and flexibility. Even with datasets of
several billion events we can achieve very good performances and
maintain the interactive query experience (most of the queries last
less than 10 seconds).

Let's see how did we manage to implement the "aggregation on query"
approach with large scale datasets.

![High level design](/docs/images/design-principles/high-level-design.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara's high-level design.**_

On the left side of the diagram we have the clients which might be
a mobile client, your services or websites, or internet websites
pushing the data to a RESTful endpoint.

The Ingestion-API will acquire the data and immediately store it into
Kafka topics. The **Kafka** cluster will replicate the events into
other machines in the cluster for fault-tolerance and durability.

Additionally a process will be continuously listening to the Kafka
topic and as the events arrive it will push the data into a deep
storage.  This can be something cloud based such as **Amazon S3** or
**Azure Storage**, a NAS/SAN in your datacenter or a **HDFS** cluster.
The idea is to store the raw stream so that no matter what happens to
the cluster and the processing infrastructure you will always be able
to retrieve the original data and reprocess it.

The next step is where the enrichment and correlation of the data
happens.  Samsara CORE is a streaming library which allows you to
define your data enrichment pipelines in terms of very simple
functions and streams composition. Stream processing shouldn't be a
specialist skill, but any developer which is mindful of performance
should be able to develop highly scalable processing pipelines.  We
aim to build the full processing pipeline out of plain Clojure
functions, so that it is not necessary to learn a new programming
paradigm but just use the language knowledge you already have.

For those who don't know the Clojure programming language, we are
considering to write language specific bindings with the same
semantics.

Implementing stateless stream processing is easy. But most of the real
world applications need some sort of _stateful stream processing_.
Unfortunately many stream processing frameworks have little or nothing
to support the correctness and efficiency of state management for
streams processing. Samsara's leverages the amazing
[Clojure's persistent data structures](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1)
to provide a very efficient stateful processing. The _in-memory_ state
is then backed by a Kafka topic or _spilled_ into a external key/value
store such as **DynamoDB**, **Cassandra** etc.

The processing pipeline takes one or more streams as an input and produces
a richer stream as an output. The output stream is stored in Kafka as
well.  Another component (`Qanal`) consumes the output streams and
indexes the data into ElasticSearch. In the same way we store the raw
data we can decide to store the processed data as well in the deep
storage.

Once the data is inside **ElasticSearch** it is now ready to be queried.
The powerful query engine of **ElasticSearch** is based on [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/)
which manages the inverted indexes. **ElasticSearch** implemented a
large number of queries and aggregations and it makes simple even very
sophisticated aggregations.

The following picture shows the list of aggregations queries which
**ElasticSearch** already implemented (v1.7.x) and more will come.

![ElasticSearch available aggregations](/docs/images/design-principles/els-aggregations.gif)<br/>
_**[~] ElasticSearch available aggregations (v1.7.x).**_

Once the data is inside **ElasticSearch** you get all the benefits of a
robust and mature product and the speed of the underlying Lucene
indexing system via a REST API. Additionally, out of the box, you can
visualize your data using **Kibana**, creating _ad-hoc_
visualizations, dashboards which work for both: real-time data and
historical data as both are in the same repository.

![Kibana visualizations](/docs/images/design-principles/kibana-visualizations.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Kibana visualizations (from the web).**_

Kibana might not be the best visualization tool out there but is a quite
good solution for providing compelling dashboards with very little
effort.

### <a name="cloud"/> Cloud native vs Cloud independent.

The discussion around cloud native architectures with their benefits
versus the drawbacks is always a hot topic while designing a new
system.  Advocates from both sides have good reasons and valid
arguments.  Cloud native is usually easier to operate and scale, but
with the risk of vendor lock-in. Cloud independent has to rely only on
basic infrastructure (IaaS) when running on a cloud and not use any of
the proprietary PaaS services.  With Samsara we went a step
further. We composed the system with tools which have a cloud PaaS
counterpart.

**Kafka**, **Amazon Kinesis** and **Azure EventHubs** try to solve the
same problem.  Similarly **Cassandra**, **Riak**, **DynamoDB**,
**Azure Table Storage** are again very similar from a high level
view. So while designing Samsara we've took care of not using
functionalities which were not available in other platforms or which
couldn't be implemented in some other way.

The result is that the system can preserve some guarantees across the
different clouds and even provide the same functionality when running
in your own data-center.

The next picture shows some of the interchangeable parts in Samsara's
design.


![Cloud alternatives](/docs/images/design-principles/cloud-support.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Green parts are available as of 0.5, the other ones soon to come.**_


### <a name="slack"/> Cutting some slack.

One design principle I was very keen to observe was to build around
every layer some **fail-safe**. In this case I'm not talking about the
fault-tolerance against machine failures, but specifically fail-safe
against **human failures**.  If you have ever worked in any larger
project you know that failures introduced by humans mistakes are by
large the most frequent type of failures.  The idea of adding some sort
of resilience against human mistakes is not new.  The old and good
database backup is probably one of the earliest attempt to deal with
this issue. For many years, while designing new systems, I tried to
include some sort of fail-safe here and there, but I wasn't aware of a
appropriate name for it. so when people were asking why, my short
answer was something like: _"... because, you know; you never know
what can go wrong"_. It wasn't until 2013 when I watched
[Nathan Marz talk on "Human Fault-Tolerance"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipjrhue5bXs)
which it came clear to me what was the pattern to follow.  In the same
way we try to take into account machine failures, network
failures, power failures etc in our design we should also account for
human failures.

In the talk, Nathan illustrates principles which, if applied, could be
treated as general pattern for human fault-tolerance.  The general
idea is: **if you are building a data system, and you _build upon
immutable facts_, then storing the raw data, you can always go back
and rebuild the entire system based on the raw, immutable facts plus
the corrected algorithms**. This really resonated with what I was
trying to do.

Samsara encourages to publish small essential facts. By definition
they are always "true".  Samsara stores them in durable storage so
that _no matter what happens later, you always have the possibility to
go back and reprocess all the data_.

Samsara cares also to make it easy to rebuild a consistent
view of the world, so it gives you support for publishing
external dataset as streams of event as well. Finally we avoid
duplicates in the indexes which could be caused by re-processing the
data by assigning repeatable IDs to every event, at the cost of some
indexing performance loss. This is a deliberate choice, and it has is
foundation in the concept of _human fault-tolerance_.

There are many other little changes which have been made to support
this idea I hope you will agree with me that the system is overall
better with them.

---

## <a name="kafka"/> Kafka.

Samsara's design relies a lot on Kafka primitives. For this reason I'm
going to quickly introduce Kafka design detailing why and how we use
these primitives to build a robust system for our processing
infrastructure.

[Apache Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is a fast, fault-tolerant,
append-only distributed log service. At its core there is the log
structure. The log contains messages, every message has an offset, a
payload and optionally a partition-key. The offset is a monotonically
increasing number and can be utilized to identify a particular message
in a specific log.  The payload, from Kafka point of view, is just a
byte array, which can have a variable size. The partition key is
specified by the producer (sender) together with the message's payload
and it is used for data locality (more on this later).

![Kafka log](/docs/images/design-principles/kafka-log.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] The log structure of Kafka.**_

The log is not a single continuous file, but is divided into segments
and every segment is a file on disk.  The consumer (reader) chooses
which messages to read, and because once written log never
changes (just appends new records), the consumer doesn't need to send
acknowledgments, for the messages which it consumed back, to the server
but it needs only to store what was the offset of the last consumed
message.

Kafka has the concept of _topics_. Topics are used to divide messages
for different domains. For example a topic called _"users"_ could
contains users updates, while a topic called _"metrics"_ could
contains devices sensors reading or services events.  Topics are
divided into _partitions_, and every partition is just a log. Topics
can have multiple partitions and they are replicated on multiple
machines for fault-tolerance.

![Kafka partitions](/docs/images/design-principles/kafka-partitions.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] A topic is composed of partitions (logs) and replicated across the cluster.**_

When a producer sends a message to a topic it specifies the _topic name_,
the message _payload_ and optionally a _partition-key_.  The broker,
to decide which partition must store the given message, hashes the
message-key and based on the hash fixes a partition.  This is a very
important aspect as _all messages which contain the same partition
key are guaranteed to be in the same partition_. Such data locality is
very important to implement aggressive caching and perform stream
processing without requiring coordination. In Samsara we use the
`sourceId` as partition key. The `sourceId` is typically and
identifier of the agent or device which is producing a event.  So it
means that all messages sent by a particular source will always end up
in the same partition, therefore it guarantees a total ordering of the
messages. If the partition key is not given (or null) then a random
partition is picked.

All partitions and replicas are spread across the cluster to guarantee
high-availability and durability. Every partition has one and only one
partition leader across the cluster at any point in time, and all
messages are sent to the partition leader.

Kafka offers policy based evictions of three kinds: based on time,
on size and a special eviction called _compaction_

![Kafka compaction](/docs/images/design-principles/kafka-compaction.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Kafka eviction policy: compaction.**_

The **time based eviction** deletes messages beyond a configurable
amount of time. For example you can configure Kafka to retain all
messages for a given topic for one week.  Once the week is past
messages are automatically deleted.

The **size based eviction** deletes the oldest messages when the total
size of a topic exceed a given size. For example you can configure
Kafka to keep _at most_ 2TB of data for a given topic.

The **compaction based policy** is quite interesting. The compaction
agent only works on non-active segments. For every message in older
segments, it looks at the partition key and it takes last message for
every partition key. Like in the picture, partition keys in messages
are represented by the different colors, only last message for every
partition-key is copied into a new segment and the old one is then
removed. For example if you have three updates from "John" and two
from "Susanne" then the compacted log will contain only two messages:
last message from "John" and last message from "Susanne".

This type of compaction is very useful when messages represent state
changes for a given key. Similarly to a transaction log of a database,
where last change is last state. If you have such situation then you
can use this type of compaction to efficiently store the state changes
by key, and have Kafka cleaning up the old copies for you
automatically.  To rebuild the state all you need to do in to apply
the state of last message for every key.


## <a name="core"/> Samsara processing CORE.

Now that we have seen how the fundamentals parts of Kafka do work we
can see how Samsara CORE leverages them to produce a high throughput
scalable processing system.

Firstly the CORE idea is that your stream processing is just a function
which takes in input a topic and produces the output into another
topic.  In this context we will refer to topics as **streams**, and
since streams are potentially infinite, then the processing function
has to be able to process an unbounded stream, streams get chunked as
the data arrives and every chunk will contain one or more events.

![Samsara CORE processing](/docs/images/design-principles/core-processing.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara CORE processing.**_

The processing function can essentially do one of these three operations:

  - **filtering**: where given one event it decides whether this
    particular event isn't of interest for the system and it drops it.
  - **enrichment**: where a single event is transformed and new
    dimensions/properties are added.
  - **correlation**: where the relation between events can produce
    one or more completely new events.


### <a name="core_filtering"/> Filtering.

This is the simplest processor you can have, given an event you can
decide whether to keep the event (return it) or drop it (return
`nil`).

    ƒ(e) -> e | nil

When working with systems which do aggregation on query, you typically
want to store all events you receive, so isn't very common to have
loads of filters. However in your processing you might correlate two
or more simpler events to generate new richer high level events which
are both: more complete and contain all information which you have on
the simpler ones.  In such cases you often might want to drop the
simpler ones as they are less informative and harder to query than the
high level ones.  You can build a filtering function from a
conventional predicate functions.


### <a name="core_enrichment"/> Enrichment.

The enrichment functions are the most common. It is here where you can
add all the additional information that you know about a particular event.
The enrichment function is a function which takes one event and it returns
a richer event or `nil`.

    ƒ(e) -> e' | nil

If an enrichment function returns `nil` it means that it doesn't have
any enrichment to do with this particular event. This semantic sugar
allows very idiomatic code in Clojure, and avoid accidental dropping
of events. In fact the only way you can eliminate an event is via a
filtering function.

Common uses of the enrichment functions are to add calculated
attributes, or to add additional properties from internal
data-sources.  For example you might receive an event from a device
and look up in your company data-sources for the owner. Or if you
receive an event from a user with its `userId` you could lookup in
your user's data-source for more information about the particular
user. Adding this information directly into the event allows you to
easily make queries based on user's properties.


### <a name="core_correlation"/> Correlation.

The correlation type of functions allow you to produce completely new
events.  You typically going to use other events which you might have
already seen in your processing stream to generate new events. One
common example could be that your system receives events which denote
the _starting_ and the _stopping_ of an activity and you could use a
correlation function to generate one new event which represent the
activity itself and its duration (Samsara has a module which provides
this functionality).

The correlation function is a function which given an event can
return zero, one or more events.

    ƒ(e) -> [] | [e1] | [e1 e2 ... en]

Also here if the correlation function returns `nil` it is considered as a
no-operation (no new events are generated).  One interesting aspect of
correlation functions is that the newly generated events are inserted
in-place in the stream and processed with the entire processing
pipeline like if they were received from a client.  This approach
simplifies a lot the processing pipeline as you have the guarantee
that **every event will go through the entire pipeline** even if the
correlation function produced them mid-way in your processing.

The following image shows how the events are processed and what happens
when a correlation function generates new events.

_**[~] The correlation adds new events `in-place` in the stream, like if they were sent by the client.**_


### <a name="core_pipeline"/> Composition: Pipeline.

We've seen how you can organize your processing semantics into simple
building blocks like the functions which perform the _filtering,
enrichment and correlation_. However any non trivial processing will
require to define many of these different functions.  Samsara allows
to compose these simple functions in more complex and structured
pipelines. Like the Clojure function
[`comp`](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/comp) which is used to
compose many functions into one, Samsara offers a function called
`pipeline` which will compose filtering, enrichment and
correlation functions into a single processing pipeline.

Like the picture below shows, `pipeline` can take many different
functions (with different input/output shapes) and compose them into a
single function which will be the equivalent of all single functions
executed one after the other one _in the given order_.

![Samsara CORE - composition: pipeline ](/docs/images/design-principles/core-pipeline.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara allows you to compose your stream processing from very simple building blocks.**_

Samsara also offers tools to visualize a pipeline and produce a flow
diagram with the different functions.

Enrichment, filtering, correlation and the ability to compose them
into pipelines are provided as a library called `moebius` which is
part of Samsara. I've designed this as a separate library so that your
processing pipelines can be designed, built, and **tested**, in
complete isolation using just pure functions without requiring a
running cluster or complex testing infrastructure. Once your
processing pipelines are build you can test them by providing events
directly and verifying the expected output. No mocking required, just
pure functions.

### <a name="core_state"/> State management.

So far we have seen how to do **stateless stream processing** which is
the easiest form.  However most of real-world projects require more
complex processing semantics which often are powered by _transitory
computational state_.

Some stream processing frameworks have little or nothing to help
developers to get **stateful stream processing** right.  Without
support, developers have little or no choice to use their own custom
approach to **state management**.

In this section we are going to see various approaches used by different
frameworks and then we are going to explore Samsara's approach.

The first approach is to store your processing state using an external
DB cluster, typically a k/v-store such as: _Cassandra, Dynamo, Riak_
to name a few.

This is the easiest approach but also the weakest one as well. Even if
your database is well tuned, as the processing rate grows, it is
likely to become a bottleneck in your processing. After a certain
stage it will become harder and harder to scale your stream processing
system due to the database. Database are much harder to scale, even
system like Cassandra which scale very well, sooner or later will become
the dominant part in your execution time. To push the database beyond
certain points requires more nodes. While your stream processing will
be quite fast with a modest number of machines, your DB, likely will
require huge clusters.

The following picture shows processing nodes connecting to an external
k/v-store to persist their transitory state.

![External state management](/docs/images/design-principles/state-external.gif)<br/>
_**[~] The simplest approach (not good) is to use external k/v-store.**_

One additional challenge in case of processing failures is that the
state can get easily out-of-sync. For example the processing
node might have stored successfully the data into the k/v-store, but it failed to
checkpoint it's own progress.

The second approach is to use the data-locality offered by Kafka, and
the guarantee that all events coming from a given source will always
be landing in the same partition. Keeping this important fact in mind,
it is possible to use local (to the node) caches such as: _Redis,
Memcache and RocksDB_ to name a few.

![Local state management](/docs/images/design-principles/state-local.gif)<br/>
_**[~] A local cache offers better latency and better scalability profile.**_

Because every node is independent from the others it is much easier to
scale. While in the external database the read/write latencies are in the
order of _1-10ms_, with the local cache the latency is typically
around _100𝛍s-2ms_. However you still have to incur the serialization
and de-serialization costs on every read/write.

In Samsara we designed a _in-memory k/v-store_ using the fabulous
[Clojure's persistent data structures](http://hypirion.com/musings/understanding-persistent-vector-pt-1)
to store the state. To guarantee durability we back changes into a
Kafka topic which is used to store the state only. Samsara's k/v-store
produces a _transaction log_ of all the changes made to the in-memory
data and when Samsara writes the output of the processing into the
output topic, it writes the changes to the state into the kv-store
topic.


![Samsara's state management](/docs/images/design-principles/state-samsara.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara's kv-store is in-memory and in-process.**_

The use of Clojure persistent data structures makes the k/v-store
friendlier to the JVM Garbage Collection, and being in process there
is no serialization costs of every read/write. The typical latencies
for Samsara's k/v-store are _**100ns read, 1𝛍s write**_, additionally
every thread has his own thread-local k/v-store which eliminates
contentions and the need of coordination (locks), overall it has just
better data locality for your process.  If your processing state is
way bigger than the available memory on your nodes you have two
options: the first one is to add more nodes and distribute the
processing across more partitions. If this isn't viable for solution
cost-wise you can have the k/vs-store to _spill_ into an external db
cluster. Such solution is still better than making db lookups for
every event as the k/v-store will only go to the external db in case
of a cache-miss and will only store when the entire batch has been
processed (not for every single event). Considering that events from a
given source tend to arrive in batches due to the client buffering it
is easy to understand the advantages of this approach compared to the
first approach we discussed. If you are really sensitive to the
latencies the only solution is to add more nodes.

Finally, let's see how Samsara is fault tolerant in respect to the
state management. We said earlier that the k/v-store we use is in
memory, so what happens if a node dies?

The following picture illustrate what are the steps in such case.

![Samsara's state management fault tolerance](/docs/images/design-principles/state-samsara-ft.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara's state management fault tolerance.**_

  1. The system is running and all nodes are consuming their own share
     of partitions.
  2. As events are processed the output is written into the _output
     topic_ and the state changes are persisted into the k/v-store
     topic.
  3. The "node 2" dies due to a machine failure. The processing of
     that partition stops. In memory state is lost.
  4. After some time the machine comes back alive.
  5. Samsara initializes the k/v-store using the transaction-log
     in its own topic.
  6. After the full state is restored, the node starts to process
     events from the partition as before, with the exact state that
     was left before the failure.

To avoid that the k/v-store topic becomes huge impacting the
restart time we use the _Kafka's compaction feature_ for this topic.
So over time only latest copy of the keys will be kept.

This pattern is used by other processing systems notably Apache Samza and
the very new Kafka-Streams.

This is the way Samsara maintains state and offers a support for the
stateful stream development directly in its core. All functions which
process events that we seen earlier such as _filtering, enrichment and
correlation_ they all have a stateful variant as well.  In the
stateless processing they only accept an event, if you need stateful
processing, then they will accept the current state and the event.

![Samsara's stateful processing functions](/docs/images/design-principles/stateful-fn.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara's stateful processing functions.**_

Stateful functions and the stateless ones can be mixed in the same
pipeline.  The `pipeline` function takes care of passing the state to
these functions which requires one and only the event to the stateless
ones.

Earlier we said that the stream processing is a function of the input
stream to produce an output stream, now for you stateful stream
processing we can say that is a function of the input stream and the
state topic, to produce output stream and an update state topic.

![Samsara's stateful processing](/docs/images/design-principles/stateful-proc.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara's stateful processing representation.**_

Finally if you have internal data sources which you want to use to
enrich your data you can provide them as a stream and Samsara will
convert them into k/v store.  This is often useful when you have
internal data-source such as your `users` database or your `products`
catalog etc which you might want to join with incoming events enriching
them with additional dimensions.

![Samsara's support for data-sources](/docs/images/design-principles/stateful-dimensions.jpeg)<br/>
_**[~] Samsara support external datasource as streams.**_

These _dimesions_ are available in your processing functions as globally accessible
in-memory k/v-stores, and because they are just streams of changes, they can be
updated while the application is running without downtime.

## <a name="why"/> Why should you choose Samsara.

I designed Samsara because I think that although many systems allow
you to do stream processing, the stream processing part is just a
small part, albeit important, of delivering a system which provides
real-time analytics. Samsara is a full stack. We provide clients for
your devices or your services, we provide a way to ingest the data, we
provide an easy and scalable solution for events processing, a very
fast storage, visualization, dashboards, and a number of built-in
modules to facilitate common scenarios.

All other alternative solutions are either not providing the full
stack, or they are proprietary services and very expensive solutions.
With Samsara you have a open source solution that lets you keep your
own data, and provides all the capabilities to build very
sophisticated models.

I've used this system to build a real-time recommendation engine.
Because the processing system is made of just plain Clojure functions
and its execution model is very clear, you can easily develop extend
the system to build new products or services with the same platform.

Having a real-time analytics system as part of your services is
invaluable. You can understand how users interact with your services
as it is happening. You can use it for general analytics, you can use
it as a Multi Variant Testing (MTV) system, you can use it for
monitoring KPIs and in many other different way.

Many BI solutions rely on batch systems which have incredibly high
latencies, Samsara is performing incredibly well in this space.
Much of the merit has to go to ElasticSearch for this.

In the following picture there is a performance comparison which I
made for one of my clients. It was performed using the same data on
the same cluster size with similar machines.  The first query shows
the time it took Hadoop + Hive to perform a simple filtering query
with aggregation across **1.8 billion records**. The same query was then
performed with Spark + Hive and ElasticSearch.

![Query performance comparison](/docs/images/design-principles/performance-comp.gif)<br/>
_**[~] Query performance comparison.**_

You can see the incredible difference, _6 seconds_ against the 2 hours
for Hadoop. Samsara with ElasticSearch enables an interactive data
exploration experience that other products are just not able to
provide.

I hope the reader will find this description interesting and that it
helped to shed some light on Samsara's internals. Try the
